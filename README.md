# static-site-generator
Static site generator from scratch. Boot.dev guided project

### Project description from boot.dev:
Ever wondered how static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby work? In this guided project you'll build your own from scratch using Python. You'll put a lot of your learnings from Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming to use in a tangible web project. This project isn't for the faint of heart, but it's well worth the effort. You'll come away with a deeper understanding of static content management. \
